# Savings Goal Feature

## Overview
The savings goal feature allows users to set a monthly savings target. The progress bar shows 100% when the current balance meets or exceeds the goal, and decreases as the balance drops below the goal due to expenses.

## How It Works

### Setting a Savings Goal
1. Navigate to the Savings page
2. Click "Set Goal" or "Update Goal" button
3. Enter your desired monthly savings amount
4. The goal is set for the current month

### Goal Behavior
- **Savings Goal**: The amount you set as your savings target
- **Current Balance**: Your actual balance (income - expenses)
- **Progress**: Shows what percentage of your goal you've maintained
  - 100% when balance â‰¥ goal
  - Decreases as balance drops below goal

### Progress Bar Logic
- **100% (Green)**: Current balance meets or exceeds savings goal
- **75-99% (Green)**: Maintaining most of your savings goal
- **50-74% (Amber)**: Savings goal is being reduced
- **25-49% (Orange)**: Savings goal is significantly reduced
- **0-24% (Red)**: Savings goal is severely impacted

### Automatic Updates
- Progress updates automatically when transactions are added
- Goals are reset monthly (new month = new goal opportunity)

## API Endpoints

### Set Savings Goal
```
POST /api/savings/goal
Body: { "initialGoal": number }

## Database Schema

### SavingsGoal Model
```prisma
model SavingsGoal {
  id              Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  initialGoal     Float    // Original goal amount
  currentGoal     Float    // Remaining goal after expenses
  month           DateTime // Month this goal applies to
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  user            User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId          Int

  @@unique([userId, month])
}
```

## Frontend Components

### SetSavingsGoalModal

### Updated SavingPage

## Integration Points

### Transaction Controller
- Automatically calls `updateSavingsGoalOnExpense` when expenses are added
- Updates the current goal in real-time

### Budget Controller
- No longer handles savings goals (moved to dedicated savings controller)
- Focuses on category-based budgets
